# 🔐 Password Generator Web App

A sleek and secure password generator built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This app gives users full control over the structure of their password (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols) — and adds an extra layer of complexity through a **custom algorithm** based on a twisted Collatz sequence starting with a **random prime number**. 🧠⚡

## 🧠 How It Works

Instead of picking characters purely at random, this app starts with a **random prime number** and evolves it using a variation of the **Collatz sequence**. Each transformed number is then **mapped to a character** in a controlled yet pseudo-random way, ensuring:

- 🔁 Repeatability without repetition
- 🎲 High entropy
- 💪 Strong password structure
